# Carl Klein's GitHub

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Carl Klein. When I'm not in the mountains, I'm fine tuning my data science skills.

*Also see me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-klein/).*

I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in data science (MSDS) at [CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu).

Prior to this, I was working as a Benefits Data Analyst in the insurance industry. Initially, I had actuarial aspirations, 
inspired by my time at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/), where I studied mathematics (Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, minor
in Applied Mathematics).

Small scale automation projects during my time as a Benefits Data Analyst helped me start to develop a programming
repertoire. I kept building the programming toolkit, eventually merging this with my passion for mathematics lead me to the data science pathway.

## Rudimentary Python Projects
As I was just starting to practice coding in python. Additionally, added to my portfolio prior to a fuller understanding
of Git and writing "proper" READMEs.

- [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/clickityKlein/Expense_Tracker)
- [Linear Algebra Tools](https://github.com/clickityKlein/Linear_Algebra)


## VBA Projects
My inital projects were small scale automation projects while I was a Benefits Data Analyst. These were VBA based, as
the majority of my team's work was in Excel. Additionally, these were added to my portfolio prior to a fuller understanding
of Git and writing "proper" READMEs.

*These models were built in a generalized scope prior to implementing at my workplace.*
