- Mountains, Coding, and Math!
- Hi, I’m Carl Klein. I'm currently a data analyst in the insurance industry. Originally on the actuarial pathway, I'm interested in a data science.
- After obtaining an undergraduate degree in mathematics (major in Mathematics, minor in Applied Mathematics), passing the "Probability" actuarial exam (Exam P/1), and getting some data analysis experience under my belt, I started looking into automation.
- I had some programming training during my college years, so after my getting feet wet in my first job, I started wondering how to complete tasks quicker and with greater accuracy.
- Due to several factors, my virtual environment was limited to Excel and Office Products. Enter VBA! After taking a course in VBA, I completed several projects using the langauge. A few of the "generic" versions are shared on this profile.
- Teaching myself VBA and working on several projects using this language ignited a passion for programming in me. Another one of my great passions is mathematics, especially applied mathematics.
- Programming... plus Mathematics... this added up to a data science pathway...
- My current focuses are on Python, SQL, and data science concepts.
- Looking forward to being a part of this community!
